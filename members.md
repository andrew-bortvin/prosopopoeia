  	As a performer and researcher of Renaissance and Baroque vocal music, American vocalist Julie Knott is committed to music from centuries past, presented through a modern and socially relevant lens. Based in Baltimore, Maryland, she is an avid performer of opera, oratorio, and art songs with a specialization in early music and plainchant. Julie’s 2026 engagements include: her debut with Lorelei Ensemble under the direction of Dr. Beth Willer, on Julius Eastman’s Colors at Yale University, a recital at the Greene Space in New York City hosted by the Gerda Lissner Foundation and Peabody Conservatory, Bach’s St. Matthew Passion with the Baltimore Basilica Schola and early music ensemble “Three Notch’d Road,” premiering the role Sally in Kin Psalms, a new opera by Josiah Garza at the 2640 space in Baltimore, and a spring concert series around the DMV with Prosopopoeia Ensemble. A native of central Pennsylvania, Julie has collaborated with the Hershey and West Shore Symphony Orchestras, as the soloist in Poulenc’s Gloria and Orff’s Carmina Burana, respectively. Julie is a graduate student at the Peabody Institute studying Historical Performance in the voice studio of Ms. Elizabeth Futral.
